# Depth-LIB-Android-
A library that gives depth/thickness to Views. It also contains some examples of Canvas drawing techniques to create particle systems, waves and grain effect. I wasn't really happy with the default shadows in Android beacuse they start misbehaving when they are rotated so I made my own shadow solution. Don't expect to much from this lib, it was written as a quick prototype, so the visuals look good but the code behind it could have been better. I haven't tested the code in over a year since I haven't been working with Android development for the last year.
