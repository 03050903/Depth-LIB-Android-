# Depth-LIB-Android-
A library gives depth to Views. It also contains some examples of Canvas drawing techniques to create particle systems, waves and grain effect. Don't expect to much from this lib, it was written as a quick prototype, so the visuals look good but the code behind it could have been better structured. Also I haven't tested the code in over a year since I have not been working with Android development for the last year.
